===Description===
Sekur.me plugin eliminates UserIDs and Passwords, securely and conveniently. It is a million times more secure than the most complex UserID/Password combinations. It turns your phone into your digital identification, that can not be faked, copied or modified.

Combined with the free Sekur.me app (iPhone and Android), it provides Multi-Factor authentication, including Location aware logins. You can specify the locations or geographical areas where one is allowed to login. Alternatively, you can allow logins from anywhere, except certain geographical areas. Login at http://my.sekur.me to setup your location filters. Also, if you lose your phone, you can disable Sekur.me via http://my.sekur.me
